To compile the project, use the makefile by running the command "make"
To remove the compiled files, run "make clean"

The project contains 3 main files/commands
rm, which is used with the command "./rm [-f -h -r] file [file...]"
dv, which is used with the command "./dv [-h] file [file...]"
dump, which is used with the command "./dump [-h]"

runTests.sh is a bash script that runs tests if used on my machine

Setup:
